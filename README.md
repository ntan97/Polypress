# Polypress
A basic theme template to integrate Polymer 1.0 to WordPress. This is a work in progress, and any help and pull requests will be accepted

What is this:
- A work in progress.
- A failure in progress.
- An attempt to combine some of the amazing Polymer APIS and Google things, with all the beautiful WordPress things we all know and love.

What is this not:
- A finished product, in an way, shape or form.
- 

What are the goals for this?
1. Create a skeleton theme that includes all the default styles and functionality of Polymer directly intergrated with WordPress
2. Build off of and continuously improve as both WordPress and Polymer advance.

Why?
Why not.
